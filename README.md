# Advanced-Assessment
This assignment was given to me by thinkful for software engineering flex.

These are the requirements for the test:

Question 1
  All tests are passing in Qualified.

Question 2
  The student did not include any single-letter variables.

Question 3
  The student made at least one use of an arrow function.

Question 4
  The student made at least one use of each of the following native array methods: find(), filter(), map(), and reduce().

Question 5
  The student created at least one function that helps support the tested functions.

Question 6
   The student used at least two of the following JavaScript features: ternary operators, spread operator, object shorthand, array or object destructuring, and for/in loops.

Question 7
  Note two things that the student could improve upon.

Question 8
  Note two things that the student did well.

You will find all files necessary to test the assessed functions and plenty of pseudocode (i tried to be somewhat original but alot of pseudocode looks the same :( )
This readme will be useless
